    <br>
    <p>Your payoff in randomly selected round is {{ payment_payoff }}.</p>
    <p>The threshold is {{ threshold }} and the conversion rate is {{ exchange_rate }}</p>

    <p>Therefore, your payment in selected round is \( ( {{ payment_payoff }}*{{ period_length }} - {{ threshold }} ) /{{ exchange_rate }} = $ {{ payment_in_dollar }} \)</p>
<h5> <b style="color:#1E8BDC"> Your total payment is as follows: </b> </h5>
<table class="table">
    <tr>
    <td>Payment in Selected Round</td>
    <td>${{ payment_in_dollar }}</td>

<tr>

    <td>${{ show_up }}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
