            Information about Payment
        </h3>

    <p>
        At the end of the last round, the computer will randomly select one of the non-practice rounds for payment.
    </p>
        <p>
        The threshold is 1000 and the conversion rate is 180 points per dollar today.
       </p>
        <p>
<ol>
    <li>If in the selected round you had an average payoff rate of 12, your take home payment would be \( ( 12*180 - 1000 ) /180 = $6.4 \) plus the show-up fee of $6.</li>
    <li>If in the selected round you had an average payoff rate of 15, your take home payment would be \( ( 15*180 - 1000 ) /180 = $9.4 \) plus the show-up fee of $6.</li>
    <li>If in the selected round you had an average payoff rate of 20, your take home payment would be \( ( 20*180 - 1000 ) /180 = $14.4 \) plus the show-up fee of $6.</li>
