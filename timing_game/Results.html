    <p>
        At the end of the last round, the computer will randomly select one of the non-practice rounds for payment.
    </p>
        <p>
        The threshold is 1,000 and the conversion rate is 180 points per dollar today.
       </p>
        <p>
<ol>
    <li>If in the selected round you had an average payoff rate of 15, your take home payment would be \( ( 15*150 - 1000 ) /180 = $6.9 \) plus the show-up fee of $7.</li>
    <li>If in the selected round you had an average payoff rate of 20, your take home payment would be \( ( 20*150 - 1000 ) /180 = $11.1 \) plus the show-up fee of $7.</li>
    <li>If in the selected round you had an average payoff rate of 25, your take home payment would be \( ( 25*150 - 1000 ) /180 = $15.3 \) plus the show-up fee of $7.</li>
